# User visible changes in `ImageProcessing` package

Non-breaking changes:
- `oneunit(x)` for a point (or a point type) `x` yields a unitful unit step point.
- Bug fix: `isless(x, y)` for points `x` and `y` compares coordinates in reverse order
  (from last to first) as for Cartesian indices.
- Non-exported public methods `ImageProcessing.front` and `ImageProcessing.tail` to
  discard the last of the first element of a tuple.
- Non-exported public method `ImageProcessing.compare_coordinates` implements coordinates
  comparison for various comparison operators following similar rules as for Cartesian
  indices.
- Non-exported public method `ImageProcessing.has_integer_coordinates(x)` to check whether
  `x` has integer coordinates.
- `Point{N,T}` inherits from `AbstractPoint{N,T}` which is an abstract vector. Most of the
  point API is available for abstract points.
- New types `Interval{T}` and `BoundingBox{N,T}` to represent continuous intervals of
  values of type `T` and hyper-rectangular `N`-dimensional continuous regions of
  `N`-dimensional points of coordinate type `T` and with axes aligned with the Cartesian
  axes.
- `f = hard_thresholder(lvl)` or `f = soft_thresholder(lvl)` build a callable object `f`
  such that `f(x)` yields `hard_thresholder(x,lvl)` or `soft_thresholder(x,lvl)`.

Breaking changes:
- `IndexBox` has been removed. Use `BoundingBox` instead but the latter is continuous and
  more general than the latter which is discrete. The rational is that continuous sets are
  more flexible for coordinates computations and may be converted to some discrete
  approximation after having performed all necessary computations.
- Non-exported public methods `to_dim`, `to_axis`, `to_size`, and `to_axes` have been
  removed. Use `as_array_dim`, `as_array_axis`, `as_array_size`, and `as_array_axes` from
  the `TypeUtils` package instead.shapes.

# Version 0.2.0

- New exported function `new_array(T, args...)` to build an array with undefined elements
  of type `T` and shape `args...` that can be any number of array dimensions (integers)
  and/or axes (integer-valued unit ranges). If all shape parameters are integers or
  instances of `Base.OneTo`, an ordinary array of type `Array{T}` is returned; otherwise,
  an offset array (wrapped on top of an ordinary array) is returned.

- Non-exported public functions `ImageProcessing.to_dim`, `ImageProcessing.to_axis`,
  `ImageProcessing.to_size`, and `ImageProcessing.to_axes` to deal with array shapes.

- Extend some math functions for instances of `Point`:
  - `abs(A)`, `norm(A)`, `norm(A, 2)`, and `hypot(A)` yield the Euclidean norm of the
    vector of coordinates of point `A` while `norm(A, p)` yields the `p`-norm of the
    vector of coordinates of point `A`;
  - `min(A, B)`, `max(A, B)`, and `minmax(A, B)` work for points `A` and `B` as for
    Cartesian indices;
  - `dot(A, B)` yields the scalar product of the vectors of coordinates of points `A` and `B`;
  - `atan(A)` yields the polar angle of 2-dimensional point `A`;
  - `cross(A, B)` and `A Ã— B` yield the cross product of the vectors of coordinates of
    2-dimensional points `A` and `B`.

# Version 0.1.0

- New `OnlineSum` structure to store the sum of, possibly weighted and/or recentered,
  images.
